## 🎯 The Big Win

You're not building a product company.
You're building a **personal brand asset** that leads to consulting.

**The funnel:**
```
Try your tool → Read your blog → See your code → Star repo → Follow you
    ↓
Later: Similar problem → "Hey, can you build this?" → Consulting project
```
