# 🎯 MASTER STRATEGY: Build Personal Brand Through Functioning Prototypes

**Your Complete Vision:** Functional portfolio + Content + GitHub = Consulting Pipeline

---

## 🚀 THE BIG PICTURE

### What You're Building

**NOT:** A portfolio of projects
**NOT:** Open source tools for monetization
**NOT:** A consulting website

**ACTUALLY:** A **personal brand asset** that:
1. Shows you can actually build (working prototypes)
2. Demonstrates PM thinking (technical blog posts)
3. Proves code quality (GitHub repos)
4. Builds authority (lessons learned + insights)
5. Creates consulting pipeline (users see quality → hire you)

### The Loop

```
User discovers fullstackpm.tech
  ↓ [Tries PM Interview Coach - LIVE endpoint]
  ↓ [Impressed with quality]
  ↓ [Reads blog: "How I Built the Coach"]
  ↓ [Sees GitHub repo - clean code]
  ↓ [Impression: "This person can build"]
  ↓ [Follows you]
  ↓ [Later: "We need a tool like this"]
  ↓
💰 Consulting project ($5-50k)
```

       ↓
Me: "I'll create 8 detailed BUILD files
     specifying everything Code Puppy needs"
       ↓
You: [Send BUILD files to Code Puppy]
     "Code Puppy, implement BUILD_01"
       ↓
Code Puppy: [Reads BUILD_01.md]
            [Implements code]
            [Tests against acceptance criteria]
            [Returns all files]
       ↓
Me: [Review Code Puppy's work]
    [Score: 95/100 - Approved!]
       ↓
You: [Copy files to repo]
     [Test locally]
     [Write blog post]
     [Deploy + share]
