A Full Stack PM blends product strategy, technical fluency, and hands-on execution. It is not about writing code for its own sake — it is about reducing the distance between insight and shipped value. When you can prototype, test, and iterate alongside engineers, you become faster, more credible, and more decisive.

## The New PM Skill Stack

The role shifts from coordination to creation. You still set vision, but you also shape the systems that bring that vision to life. That means understanding architecture, making smart trade-offs, and building artifacts that speak the same language as engineering.

> “The best PMs don’t just manage complexity — they help remove it.”

A Full Stack PM typically demonstrates:

- Ability to translate strategy into technical requirements
- Comfort with data tooling and model evaluation
- Willingness to prototype interfaces and workflows
- Obsession with feedback loops and rapid iteration

Here is a small example of how I document product experiments in code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ProductExperiment:
    hypothesis: str
    metric: str
    expected_delta: float

experiment = ProductExperiment(
    hypothesis="LLM-first onboarding reduces time-to-value",
    metric="Activation within 7 days",
    expected_delta=0.15,
)
print(experiment)
```

The payoff is a product leader who can sense constraints early and ship clearer outcomes. It is not about replacing specialists; it is about becoming the connective tissue between vision, design, data, and implementation. That is the future I am investing in.
